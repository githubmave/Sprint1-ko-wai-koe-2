Kia ora  
Ko Matairangi taku maunga,  
Ko Te awakairangi taku awa,  
Ko Te Whanganui-a-Tara taku kainga noho hou,  
Ko Wiwi taku turangawaewae,  
Ko Noemie taku ingoa,  
Tena koutou.  

My family has its roots in the west part of France. I grew up in Clisson, south of Brittany, half a hour drive from the Atlantic Ocean. My name is No√©mie.
