My stepmother(Mum) was born in Christchurch but grew up in Whakapapa Village, her father (Grandad) was the first Chief ranger of Tongairiro Nathional Park.  Grandad always had facintating stories to tell about living and working in the National Park,  Mt Ruapehu and Whakapapa Skifield has been a part of the lives of many in the family due to his influence.
