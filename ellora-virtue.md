Hello, I'm Ellora!

I moved a lot when I was younger but for the majority of my childhood I lived in Nelson, New Zealand.

My dad is Kiwi, born and raised in Wellington, and my mum is Austrian. I'm pretty lucky to have family not only in New Zealand but also in Austria as it's kind of a home-away-from-home for me.
