My name is Kevin Guan and I was born and raised in Palmerston North, New Zealand. Both my parents originally moved over from mainland China many years ago when they were young to pursue a better lifestyle. The things that I like to do in my spare time is listening to music and watching videos on youtube/netflix (I mean who doesn't). 
I prefer not to be called 'Kevin' so I welcome nicknames :)
