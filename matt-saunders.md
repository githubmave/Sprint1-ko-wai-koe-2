Where I grew up: Masterton, although, given I have spent 6/7 years here since leaving Masterton as a fresh-faced 18 year-old. I now identify Wellington, as my home.
Where my family is from: Most of my family come from Whanganui, and Masterton. But if you want to go back further than that... Europe probably?
My name: Matthew Aaron Saunders
