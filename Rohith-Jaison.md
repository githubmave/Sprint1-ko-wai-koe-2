Hi, I am Rohith.
Most of my childhood was in India till the age of 13. To be specific, I'm from the south side of India
It was at that stage my family decided to move to NZ. Coming here was the biggest leap for me. 
Last 11 years taught me lot of things both good and bad. I believe my biggest support is my family.
