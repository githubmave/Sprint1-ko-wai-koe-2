Tena Koutou katoa :)  I'm karla hogan, from paradise Mahia and Ruatorea :), grew up on the coast and Welly. I have 9 year old twins who I happily left with my parents in Mahia during my study here haha. Grateful to the Dev Academy for coming up to Gissy last year for a seminar explaining what its all about, and wanting to bring it to the regions :)  Everything Rohan said really resonated, but I came to Welly in Jan for a weekend and just felt right to do the course here.
