*Kia ora friends,*

My name is Michael Rua and I was born in Auckland . I grew up in various suburbs but seemed to settle for the last long while in St Heliers and it’s definitely home.

I recently have been thinking/ talking and just moving around the idea of lifestyle, specifically the change of it I am experiencing and the excitement and fear of waiting to see how things change with time.

I always valued the free time my old career in AirNZ gave me. Although that time was generally having mid week days off or being in another country with crew members and not my loving partner or family to spend it with. At the time I felt it was the best lifestyle because I could go motorbiking, food shopping, to the gym and beach etc outside of peak hours when everyone was working and I had pretty good days off.

Now that I am no longer flying I have had time to reflect on the friends events I missed because I was away or the family events I had to leave early for because I had a 5am start the next morning. I’ve realized I actually appreciate a consistent routine that I have now, something I have never had before. I am loving the ability to spend my weekends without work and have quality time with the people I care about most. It feels strange to be happy that i’m busier now but have structure.

Im at Dev Academy for a similar reason to many here, I’ll keep this part brief. I am here to learn, grow, adapt and swear at my computer!

I already have been doing a bit of that so far and I look forward to learning from all of you in the coming weeks.
